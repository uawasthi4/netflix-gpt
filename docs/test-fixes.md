# Test Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document explains how we fixed failing tests in our Netflix-GPT React application, specifically focusing on issues with Firebase Authentication testing.

## The Problems We Faced

### Problem 1: Firebase Auth Mock Issues
When running our tests, we kept getting an error saying "unsubscribe is not a function". This happened because our tests weren't properly handling the way Firebase Auth keeps track of who's logged in.

Think of it like this: When you log into Netflix, Firebase keeps watching to see if you're still logged in. When you leave, it needs to "unsubscribe" from watching. Our tests weren't cleaning up this watching process correctly.

### Problem 2: Missing Browser Features
We also ran into an error about "TextDecoder is not defined". This happened because Firebase Auth expects to run in a web browser, but our tests run in Node.js (which is more like a backend environment). It's like trying to use a web browser feature in a environment that doesn't have web browser capabilities.

## How We Fixed It

### 1. Better Firebase Auth Mocking
We rewrote how we pretend to be Firebase Auth in our tests. Here's what we did in both `Header.test.js` and `Login.test.js`:
- Set up a proper fake version of Firebase Auth at the module level
- Made sure our fake Firebase Auth behaves more like the real thing
- Added proper cleanup so tests don't interfere with each other

### 2. Adding Missing Browser Features
In our `setupTests.js` file, we added some code that provides fake versions of the browser features that Firebase Auth needs:
- Added TextEncoder and TextDecoder (these help with text processing)
- Made these available to all our tests

## The Result
After making these changes:
- All 5 test suites now pass successfully
- All 9 individual tests work correctly
- Our tests are more reliable and better reflect real-world scenarios

## Why This Matters
Having working tests is crucial because:
1. We can be confident our login system works correctly
2. We can make changes without accidentally breaking existing features
3. Our tests now better represent how the app works in a real browser

## Technical Details
For developers who need to understand the specific changes:

```javascript
// In setupTests.js
import { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } from 'util';
global.TextEncoder = TextEncoder;
global.TextDecoder = TextDecoder;

// In Header.test.js and Login.test.js
import * as firebaseAuth from 'firebase/auth';
jest.mock('../../utils/firebase', () => ({ auth: {} }));
jest.mock('firebase/auth');
```

## Future Considerations
When writing new tests that involve Firebase Auth:
1. Always remember to mock Firebase Auth at the module level
2. Make sure to clean up any auth state observers
3. Remember that we're running in Node.js, not a browser
